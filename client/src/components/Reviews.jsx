                        Mathias Langley After a decade of working in the steel fabrication industry I've found that whilst there are many 'welders' 
                        there are few true 'fabricators'. Fewer still have such meticulous attention to detail, forward planning, mechanical 
                        understanding, practical mathematical application, problem solving abilities, and self motivation as does Jim Hone.

                        I've worked with many people in this industry, only a handful stand out as being exceptional. 
                        Jim Hone stands out amongst even those few.
